# My Open-Source Script Editor

This is my first attempt at a simple script editor with keyboard shortcuts to help write scripts easily. Check the menu -> info button for details.

## Live

This project is deployed on vercel. You can find it here: https://local-script-editor.vercel.app/

## Running Locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
